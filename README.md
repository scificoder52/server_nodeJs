# My First Express.js App 🚀

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my first ever web server project built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. This is a small but meaningful step in my coding journey, and I’m excited to share it with you!

## What This Project Does 🛠️

This app is super simple (for now). Here’s what it can do:

1. **Root Route (`/`)**: If you visit the homepage, you’ll see a friendly "Hello World" message. 🌍
2. **Menu Route (`/menu`)**: Go to `/menu`, and you’ll get a JSON object listing some delicious dishes. 🍗 🐟

Here’s what the menu looks like:
```json
{
  "menu1": "chicken",
  "menu2": "mutton",
  "menu3": "fish"
}
